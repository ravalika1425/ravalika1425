# React Seed Project

This project is a React seed application, set up with a variety of tools and libraries to get you started on building a React application quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

To set up the project environment, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them.

### Additional Scripts
