# Contexts Directory

## Purpose

The `contexts` directory is dedicated to React Contexts, which provide a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This directory is crucial for managing global state, themes, user authentication, and other app-wide data in a React application.

## Structure

- **Global State**: Contains contexts that manage global application state, such as user information, UI settings, or application-wide configurations.
- **Authentication**: Houses contexts related to user authentication and authorization, including user tokens, login status, and user roles.
- **Theme**: Includes contexts for managing UI themes, such as light mode and dark mode preferences.
- **Other Contexts**: Any other contexts that don't fit into the above categories but are necessary for cross-component communication.

## Regulations

To ensure the `contexts` directory remains organized and its contents are used effectively, follow these guidelines:

1. **Modularity**: Create separate context files for different concerns. This keeps the contexts focused and manageable, and it makes it easier to understand and maintain the global state.

2. **Naming Convention**: Name the context files and the exported context objects clearly and descriptively. The names should reflect the data or functionality they provide to the application.

3. **Use Context Sparingly**: While contexts are powerful for sharing data across many components, they should be used sparingly. Overuse can lead to unnecessary re-renders and make the component tree harder to manage.

4. **Documentation**: Each context file should include comments or a README.md file explaining its purpose, the shape of the data it provides, and how it should be used within the application.

5. **Testing**: Write tests for your context providers, especially if they include complex logic or state management. This ensures that the global state behaves as expected.

6. **Optimization**: Use techniques like memoization and the `useContext` hook efficiently to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Consider splitting contexts if they become too large or if parts of the context are used independently by different parts of the application.

By adhering to these guidelines, the `contexts` directory will serve as a well-organized and efficient means for managing and distributing global application state and functionality.
