# Shared Components Directory

## Purpose

The `shared` directory within `components` is dedicated to housing reusable React components that are utilized across multiple parts of the application. These components are designed to be generic, flexible, and independent, making them easily integrable in various contexts without modification.

Shared components can include UI elements such as buttons, input fields, modals, and notification systems, as well as higher-order components or utility components that enhance or modify the behavior of child components.

## Regulations

To maintain the integrity and usability of the shared components directory, the following guidelines are established:

1. **Reusability**: Components in this directory should be broadly applicable across the application. They should not be overly specific to a particular feature or use case.

2. **Customizability**: Shared components should accept props that allow for customization of style, behavior, and content to fit the needs of their various use cases.

3. **Isolation**: Each shared component should operate independently. They should not rely on external state or direct interactions with other components outside of props and callbacks.

4. **Documentation**: Every shared component should be accompanied by documentation in the form of comments or a separate markdown file. This documentation should describe the component's purpose, the props it accepts, and any important behaviors or side effects.

5. **Testing**: Shared components should be thoroughly tested to ensure reliability. This includes unit tests for functionality and, where applicable, snapshot tests to guard against unexpected changes.

6. **Naming Conventions**: Components should have clear, descriptive names. File and folder names should match the name of the component they contain.

7. **Folder Structure**: Each shared component can have its own folder, which may include the component file itself, a stylesheet (if not using a CSS-in-JS solution), and a test file. Complex components may include subcomponents in this folder as well.

8. **Performance Considerations**: Given their widespread use, shared components should be optimized for performance to prevent rendering bottlenecks.

By adhering to these guidelines, the shared components directory will serve as a robust, flexible resource for developers, facilitating the development of consistent and maintainable UI across the application.
