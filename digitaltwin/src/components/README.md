# Components Directory

## Purpose

The `components` directory is the heart of the React application's user interface. It contains all the React components that are used to build the application's UI. This directory is organized into subdirectories that reflect the structure and the logical separation of the application, such as `pages`, `layouts`, `shared`, and feature-specific components.

## Structure

- **Pages**: Contains components that represent entire pages within the application. These are typically tied to routes.
- **Shared**: Dedicated to reusable components that can be used across multiple parts of the application. These components are generic and designed to be flexible and customizable.

## Regulations

To ensure consistency, maintainability, and ease of navigation within the components directory, the following guidelines are recommended:

1. **Logical Organization**: Components should be organized in a way that reflects their usage within the application. Commonly used components should be easily accessible.

2. **Component Naming**: Components should have clear, descriptive names. The file name should match the name of the component it exports.

3. **Functional Components**: Prefer functional components and hooks over class components to keep the codebase modern and consistent.

4. **Isolation**: Components should be self-contained and modular. They should aim to have all their logic and styling encapsulated within them.

5. **Documentation**: Each component, especially shared components, should be accompanied by documentation explaining its purpose, the props it accepts, and any important behaviors or side effects.

6. **Testing**: Components should be accompanied by tests to ensure their reliability. This includes unit tests for functionality and, where applicable, snapshot tests for UI consistency.

7. **Styling**: Prefer using a consistent styling solution across the components, whether it's CSS modules, styled-components, or any other CSS-in-JS solution.

8. **Performance Considerations**: Components should be optimized for performance, especially those that are frequently used or render large amounts of data.

By following these guidelines, the `components` directory will remain well-organized, making it easier for developers to navigate, maintain, and scale the application's UI.
