# Pages Directory

## Purpose

The `pages` directory within the `components` folder is specifically designed to house the components that represent entire pages in the application. Each component in this directory typically corresponds to a route in the application's routing configuration. The components here serve as the entry points for the different views that users can navigate to within the application.

## Structure

- Each page component should be placed in its own subdirectory within the `pages` directory. This allows for grouping any page-specific subcomponents, utilities, or styles together with the main page component.
- The name of the subdirectory and the main page component should clearly reflect the purpose or the feature of the page, making it easy to identify and locate specific pages within the codebase.

## Regulations

To ensure the `pages` directory remains organized and efficient, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **One Component Per Page**: Each subdirectory should contain a single main component that represents the entire page. This component acts as a container for other components that make up the page.

2. **Naming Convention**: The main component and its directory should have a name that clearly identifies the page. For example, a component representing a user profile page might be named `UserProfile.tsx` and located in a `/UserProfile` directory.

3. **Page-Specific Components and Utilities**: If a page requires specific subcomponents or utilities that are not used elsewhere in the application, these should be placed within the same subdirectory as the main page component. This helps in maintaining a modular structure.

4. **Documentation**: Include a README.md file in each page's subdirectory if the page's structure or logic is complex. This documentation should outline the page's functionality, key components, and any important state management or data fetching logic.

5. **Styling**: Prefer local styles for page-specific components to avoid styling conflicts and ensure styles are easy to manage. Use a consistent naming scheme for style files, such as `UserProfile.scss` for the `UserProfile` component.

6. **Testing**: Each page component should have associated tests to ensure that the page renders correctly and functions as expected. This includes unit tests for logic and snapshot tests for layout.

## Example

Here is an example structure for a `UserProfile` page within the `pages` directory:

```
/pages
  /UserProfile
    - UserProfile.tsx
    - UserProfile.scss
    - UserProfile.test.tsx
    - README.md (if needed)
```

By following these guidelines, the `pages` directory will serve as a clear and organized collection of the application's main entry points, facilitating easy navigation and maintenance of the application's UI structure.
