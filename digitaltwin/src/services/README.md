# Services Directory

## Purpose

The `services` directory is designed to encapsulate the application's logic for interacting with external services and APIs. This includes fetching data from RESTful services, sending data to a server, handling authentication, and any other interactions that involve external systems. Organizing these operations into a dedicated directory helps to separate concerns within the application, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Structure

- **API Services**: Contains files or modules that directly interact with specific external APIs. Each file typically corresponds to a different external service or a distinct aspect of a service.
- **Auth Services**: Dedicated to handling authentication and authorization, including token management, login/logout functions, and user session management.
- **Utility Services**: Includes utility functions that support the services, such as error handling, data formatting, or request configuration.
- **Hooks Services**: If using custom hooks for data fetching or service interaction, they can be placed here or in a separate hooks directory, depending on the project's organization preferences.

## Regulations

To ensure the `services` directory remains effective and manageable, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Modularity**: Break down service logic into modular files or functions. This approach makes it easier to manage and reuse service-related code.

2. **Naming Convention**: Name service files and functions clearly and descriptively. The names should reflect the external system or the specific functionality they provide.

3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling within service functions to manage and mitigate issues arising from failed external requests.

4. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for API endpoints and any sensitive information, such as API keys, to enhance security and flexibility.

5. **Documentation**: Document the purpose and usage of each service module or function. Include information about parameters, return values, and any side effects.

6. **Testing**: Write tests for your service functions to ensure they handle API interactions correctly, including successful responses and error scenarios.

7. **Asynchronous Patterns**: Prefer promises and async/await syntax for asynchronous operations to improve readability and error handling.

By following these guidelines, the `services` directory will serve as a centralized and organized way to manage all external interactions, making the application more maintainable and scalable.
