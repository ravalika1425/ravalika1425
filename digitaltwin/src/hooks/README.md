# Hooks Directory

## Purpose

The `hooks` directory is intended for custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic across components. Custom hooks allow for a clean abstraction of component logic, making it easier to share and reuse functionality without tightly coupling it to component structure. This directory can include hooks for data fetching, state management, interaction with contexts, or any other reusable logic.

## Structure

- **State Hooks**: Contains hooks that encapsulate stateful logic and state management beyond the basic `useState` hook.
- **Effect Hooks**: Houses hooks that deal with side effects, similar to `useEffect`, but encapsulate more complex or reusable logic.
- **Context Hooks**: Includes hooks that provide easy access to React context values, often using `useContext` under the hood.
- **Utility Hooks**: Any other hooks that provide reusable utility functions but don't fit neatly into the other categories.

## Regulations

To maintain an organized and efficient hooks directory, follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each custom hook should have a single responsibility. This makes hooks easier to understand, test, and reuse.

2. **Naming Convention**: Custom hooks should start with the word `use` followed by a name that describes their purpose, such as `useFetchData` or `useFormInput`.

3. **Documentation**: Document each custom hook with comments at the top of the file explaining what the hook does, its return values, and any parameters it accepts. This is crucial for other developers who intend to use these hooks.

4. **Testing**: Custom hooks should be tested to ensure their reliability. Testing hooks can be done using libraries like @testing-library/react-hooks to simulate their usage in components.

5. **Optimization**: Consider performance implications in your hooks, especially those that deal with data fetching or are likely to trigger frequent updates. Use memoization and callback hooks (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

6. **Avoid Duplication**: Before creating a new custom hook, check if similar functionality already exists within the directory to avoid duplicating logic.

By adhering to these guidelines, the `hooks` directory will serve as a valuable resource for developers, promoting code reuse and the modularization of logic within the application.
